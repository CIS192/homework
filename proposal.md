# Final Project
> Proposal due November 21st at 11:59 PM. Code due over reading days.

## Description
The moment you have been waiting for: the final project. Create whatever you want to build; I hope by now you can see that you can do anything in Python! You are allowed to work with a partner. The project must be roughly be of a similar scale as one of the homework assignments. We encourage you to build something you can show off! You will be assigned with a TA that will bounce ideas off of you and can give you guidance throughout your project.

## Submission Requirements
1. One class definition (with at least two magic methods)
2. Two non-trivial first-party packages (e.g. json, time)
2. Two non-trivial third-party packages (e.g. Django, Tensorflow/Keras)
3. In-line documentation (i.e. comments in code)
4. `README.md` (installation instructions, code structure)
